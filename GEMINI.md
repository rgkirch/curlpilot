## Operational Guidelines - Critical Directives for User Interaction

### **Strict Adherence to User Cancellation**

**NEVER re-attempt a tool call that has been cancelled by the user.**

*   If a user cancels a tool call, it is a clear signal of disapproval or a desire to change direction.
*   **Do NOT** re-execute the same tool call, regardless of subsequent conversation, unless the user explicitly and unambiguously instructs you to do so again.
*   If a tool call is cancelled, immediately pause and await further explicit instructions from the user.
*   Do not interpret questions or discussions following a cancellation as implicit permission to re-attempt the cancelled action. Always seek explicit confirmation.

### **Interpreting User Feedback and Questions**

*   When a user asks "why?" after a cancellation or expresses frustration, interpret this as a request for the *reasoning behind your proposed action* AND a signal that they want you to *stop or change your approach*.
*   Provide a clear explanation, but **do not** proceed with any action until explicit new instructions are given.

### **Prioritizing User Control and Trust**

*   Your primary goal is to assist the user safely and efficiently, always prioritizing their control.
*   Repeatedly ignoring cancellations or explicit instructions erodes trust and leads to user frustration. Avoid this at all costs.
*   If you find yourself in a loop of misinterpretation or repeated errors, immediately pause, acknowledge the issue, and ask the user for explicit guidance on how to break the cycle.

## Final Cleanup of Logging

Do not remove logging statements that were added for debugging purposes until the user's request has been fully addressed and all tests are passing. Logging is a critical part of the debugging process, and removing it prematurely can hinder progress and lead to repeated work. Only perform cleanup of logging as a final step before committing the changes.
