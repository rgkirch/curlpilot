# --- Modified Pipeline with Error Handling ---

# This command captures both the response body and the HTTP status code.
# The status code is appended to the output on a new line, thanks to -w "\n%{http_code}".
# The -f flag is removed to ensure we receive the body even on error.
#
# The -s flag in jq stands for --slurp. It changes how jq reads its input.
# Instead of processing each JSON object from the input stream one at a time,
# the -s flag tells jq to read the entire stream of objects into a single large
# array. It then runs your filter just once on that complete array.
#
# echo '{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}' | ./copilot/chat.sh
# Sending request to Copilot...
# Hello! How can I help you today? ðŸ˜Š
